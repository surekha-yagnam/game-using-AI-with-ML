# Objective 
  Main objective is to Play Game.  
  
# Description
  Bot creates a place where the user can play the snake game. To play the game, the user must login or signup. Here we use db to store login or signup data. If the user is new to the game, he must first signup and then login. Otherwise he can directly login. We are showing some errors when the user logs into the account with the wrong password, username or without signing up directly. These errors help the user to easily correct their mistakes. In game, user give the directions to snake like move forward,backward,left,right. When the Snake hits itself or it crosses the Limited bounderies then it quit from game. Later it displays the Score of the User. Here we also offer BMI, this is a good way to find out if your height is in healthy proportion to your weight.
