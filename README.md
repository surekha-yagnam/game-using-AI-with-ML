# Description
 Here we came up with a game named Rock Paper Scissors. Here we have provided a start button and the user will have to tap the start button to start the game and the user will be asked to provide the access to his/her web camera. And he needs to record the gestures displaying either rock ,paper or scissors. The user's gestures will be taken as Player1 choice and the system randomly takes a gesture and this will be treated as player2 choice. If the two choices are rock and scissors the player whose choice is rock wins the game.And if the choices are rock and paper then the one whose choice is paper wins the game. And if the choices are paper and scissors the player whose choice is scissors wins the game.And the winner will be displayed on the screen.
